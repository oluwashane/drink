        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
        <p>
            Philip Crouse's goal has always been to offer restaurants the best tasting,
            highest quality beverages available. Over the past four years, he built Cup & Compass,
            which produces organic tea and lemonade concentrates for restaurants.Seriously Unsweetened 
            grew from conversations with his customers and his own personal love for sparkling water.
        </p>
        <p>
            In crafting the product line, he very carefully selected only
            the highest quality organic ingredients - and never any artificial sweeteners or “natural flavors.”
            Seriously Unsweetened offers the satisfaction of a bubbly refreshment, without the added chemicals 
            and sugars typically found in sodas and other flavored drinks. We’re proud to use fruit extracted from 
            fresh USDA organic produce.And we give 1% of sales to environmental non-profits
            because we like to be nice to our planet, seriously.

        <h3>RECYCLE RIGHT</h3>
        <p>
            We wish for all Seriously bottles to be recycled and re-used,
            which is why we’re donating 1% of proceeds to Recycle Across America.
            It's that simple, and every little bit can make a difference.
